# diffusion2vec
Reference implementation of Diffusion2Vec.

Diffusion to vector is a distrbiuted topological graph embedding procedure inspired by other sequence based graph embedding procedures. It is robust to graph densification and growth. The created embeddings are competitive with other sequence based embedding methods (e.g. DeepWalk/Node2Vec).
